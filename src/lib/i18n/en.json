  "HOME_INTRODUCTION_TEXT": "The heart of the Villa is an old sheepfold, built in the 1920s, which can be deduced from the significant thickness of the walls. \nIt is backed by old dry stone constructions in the Casella area, which includes a whole group of Baracuns that you can visit freely. \nYou will see, the place conceals a certain mystery... The villa was then enlarged and renovated for residential use from 1970 to the present day. \nIt has a large living room with a TV and reading corner, two comfortable sofa corners, a large fully equipped kitchen, a bathroom with bathtub and a shower room, two toilets, and \nfinally 3 adult bedrooms and a child's bedroom for two people. \nAll bedrooms have spacious closets.",
